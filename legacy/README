StoCoin.sol is Vit's clone and edit of indaHash.

AXEL.sol was produced by a Freelancer contractor who took StoCoin, took out ICO references,
replaced the old solidity named constructor methods with the new 'constructor' keyword,
added the 'emit' keyword in front of Events, deleted comments and renamed at least 1 class name.

AxelCoin is the original indaHash file with modifications made similar to what the Freelancer
contractor did.
